\title{Single Binary Effect Size - Alternative Ratio}
\usage{
bi_es_AR(data, field)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A dataframe}

\item{field}{The field within the dataframe to use as string}
}
\value{
results A dataframe with the following information

AR1 The Alternative Ration for the first category

AR2 The Alternative Ration for the second category
}
\description{
This function performs calculates the Alternative Ratio (a.k.a. Relative Risk).
}
\details{
JonB on CrossValidated suggests to use Relative Risks as effect size measure
for a binomial test, which the NCSS calls Alternative Ratio (n.d.).

The Alternative Ratio can be calculated by:
\deqn{AR = \frac{p}{\pi}}
It is simply the actual proportion (:math:\code{p}) divided by the expected proportion (\eqn{\pi}).
If the two are equal, the result will be 1.
For the interpretation it is therefor easier to look at the difference with 1.
It then informs you how much more or less likely the category is than was expected.
