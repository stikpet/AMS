Simple function to draw a Pareto chart

\details{
Unfortunately, there is no general agreed upon definition of a Pareto diagram. The most general description Iâ€™ve found was
by Kemp and Kemp (2004) who mention it is a name for a bar chart if the order of the bars have no meaning (i.e. for a nominal variable),
and they only mention that often the bars are then placed in decreasing order.

According to some authors a Pareto diagram is any diagram with the bars in order of size (Joiner, 1995; WhatIs.com, n.d.),
while others suggest that a line representing the cumulative relative frequencies should also be included (Weisstein, 2002).

Upton and Cook (2014) also add that the bars should not have any gaps, but many other authors ignore this.

I will use the following definition: a bar chart where the bars are placed in descending order of frequency.
Usually an ogive is added in the chart as well.

An ogive (oh-jive) is: "the graphs of cumulative frequencies" (Kenney, 1939).
